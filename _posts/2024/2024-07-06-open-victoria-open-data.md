title: "Opening up Victoriaâ€™s open data platform"
---

The State Government of Victoria's 'open data platform' <a href="https://www.data.vic.gov.au/about-datavic">DataVic</a> is promoted as 'the place to discover and access Victorian Government open data.' 

However, every time I've used it, I've struggled to determine what data is available. The search function caters more to users who know exactly what they're looking for rather than those exploring available data.

### Defining the problem
The DataVic platform:
- Fails to effectively showcase available datasets
- Provides insufficient discovery tools for exploring data
- Inconsistently provides detailed data profiling
