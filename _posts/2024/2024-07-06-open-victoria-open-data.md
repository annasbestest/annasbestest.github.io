title: "Opening up Victoriaâ€™s open data platform"
---

The state government of Victoria has an 'open data platform' <a href="https://www.data.vic.gov.au/about-datavic">DataVic</a> that is 'the place to discover and access Victorian Government open data.'

However, on every occasion I've gone to use it, I've found it very difficult to know what data is available. There is a search function however it better serves users that know what they're looking for rather than users who are curious
what data is available.
