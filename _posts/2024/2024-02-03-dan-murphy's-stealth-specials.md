One of my favourite websites <a href="https://pricehipster.com/">Price Hipster</a> tracks and displays the price changes of products online, allowing you to set up alerts based on your specified price threshold.

About two years ago, Dan Murphy's products stopped being displayed and tracked on Price Hipster due to unknown reasons. To this day, the products remain absent from the site.

As I had become dependent on this feature to find wine at discounted prices, I set out to build my own price tracker. This way, I could continue to complement my wife's expensive taste in <a href="https://toscanos.com.au/">Toscano's</a> cheese with equally fine wines, acquired at more affordable prices.

### Unexpected Results
I pieced together a script to collect Dan Murphy's wine price data <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">"en masse"</a>. These scripts ran several times over a few weeks to compile price snapshots, allowing me to spot price drops.

Eventually I noticed price drops on some interesting wines so I added them to my cart for checkout. Strangely, the prices at checkout did not match those captured by the data collection script. 

After some digging around, I found that the VPN used during the data collection process (to avoid the risk of Dan's perma-banning my own IP) was having a different Click&Collect store automatically assigned than my local one.

The two different Dan Murphy's stores had their own price for identical bottles of wine, and the cheaper price was not marked as a clearance or "Member Offer" offer.

For example, the two identical wines shown below have different prices as of 17/01/2024: the bottle at Kew is priced at $40.60, whereas at Alphington, it's $57.99. That's a $17 discount for a drive of less than ten minutes. There is also no indication of a sale or "Member Offer" offer when viewing the bottle with the Kew store selected.

Even more baffling than the first example, the bottle below (Fawkner store) marked as a "Member Offer" offer is priced higher than an identical bottle with no sale mentioned (Collingwood store).

### Exploring Store-based Pricing
Now aware that price drops are influenced by both time and location, I decided to look into how location affects price. Using a price snapshot from 17th January for Dan Murphyâ€™s <span style="color: #ff0000;">red wines</span>  across Victoria, I analysed whether there was any store-specific price variation for each wine. 

Out of roughly 4,900 unique red wine stock codes (which might not all be in stock), about 3,800 (around 80%) showed no difference in price between stores. If a wine had store-specific pricing and matched the lowest observed price, it was flagged and counted as a discounted wine.
