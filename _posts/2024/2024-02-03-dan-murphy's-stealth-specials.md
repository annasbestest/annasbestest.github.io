One of my favourite websites Price Hipster <a href="https://pricehipster.com/">Price Hipster</a> tracks and displays the price changes of products online, allowing you to set up alerts based on your specified price threshold.

About two years ago, Dan Murphy's products stopped being displayed and tracked on Price Hipster due to unknown reasons. To this day, the products remain absent from the site.

As I had become dependent on this feature to find wine at discounted prices, I set out to build my own data harvester and price tracker. This way, I could continue to complement my wife's expensive taste in <a href="https://toscanos.com.au/">Toscano's</a> cheese with equally fine wines, acquired at more affordable prices.
