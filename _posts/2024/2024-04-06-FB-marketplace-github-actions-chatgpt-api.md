If The Castle (1997) was filmed today, would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dik_wnOE4dk">Steve Kerrigan</a> instead be endlessly scrolling through Facebook Marketplace and forever sending screenshots of jousting sticks to the Kerrigan family WhatsApp group?

If you have explored the features of the Facebook Marketplace app, you would have noticed the feature which sends a notification when an item is listed that matches a keyword of your choice.

The problem is that it's a poorly executed feature and in my view heavily geared towards driving Facebook app engagement (eg false positive alerts) rather than what you wish it did.
