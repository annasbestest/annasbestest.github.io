With scams and fraud on the rise, I thought Iâ€™d share a personal "near miss" experience and the steps I took to minimise the chance of it happening again. Hopefully, this will never happen to you or anyone you know, but if it does, it may be helpful to know what to do and how to spot the warning signs.

### Wednesday, 9th October 2019
My entire afternoon was planned to be spent in a cramped auditorium for an 'all hands' meeting, so I decided to head home and dial in remotely. As the meeting wrapped up at around 5:30 PM, I noticed my phone signal drop out and a Telstra email notification appear.

Initially, I didn't pay too much attention to the email and thought maybe it was related to why I had lost phone service.

Moments later, I then received another notification on my phone that someone was attempting to sign into my account, and asking whether it was me.

It was then that I realised that what was happening to me was something I'd read about only a few months before! 

Of course, I immediately pressed NO, IT'S NOT ME on the sign-in prompt. 

However, I'm not sure what would have happened if I wasn't at home and connected to WiFi, so that I actually _had the ability_ to receive the prompt. Or if I was using an iPhone instead that didn't have the prompt feature as part of the Android OS.

### My SIM was swapped

An unauthorised SIM-swap attack is when an attacker convinces a telco customer service representative (over the phone or in person) that:

1. They are you.
2. They would like to move your phone service from one physical SIM card (the one in your phone) to another physical SIM.

The attacker likely has their new SIM card with them so that the swap can occur quickly. The new SIM doesn't necessarily need to be with the same telco and could be from a different Australian telco.

After the SIM swap is complete (which can take place in a matter of minutes), the attacker can then use your phone number with complete freedom, and your SIM card will be rendered inactive.

As soon as I realised that I was a victom of an un-authorised SIM-swap attack, I called my wife to ask if she was able to quickly come home so that I could use her phone to call Telstra and explain what had happened. After navigating through first-line customer service, I was eventually able to speak to someone from their fraud department. 

During this stressful experience, it was relieving to be assigned a dedicated fraud agent with a direct contact number, who was able to talk me through what had happened the next steps.

### The serious
At some point, many of us within the data community have been on the receiving end of a large email distribution list where someone is at their wit's end, trying to track down an obscure dataset and broadcasting their struggle to over 500 staff. Or, like in my experience, used an inferior dataset not knowing a more granular and accurate equivalent was available.

An internal _data discovery tool_ having capabilities like those demonstrated above could drive business efficiency by making it easier to identify and acquire accurate and relevant data. It would also promote awareness of organisational data and encourage innovation with data that is otherwise under-utilised.

While this was a quick and dirty bedroom experiment on a relatively small library of data (using around 25% of the 2M token capacity), Google Gemini's token size is constantly increasing, making it more viable to explore similar applications of this technology in organisations with larger data libraries.
