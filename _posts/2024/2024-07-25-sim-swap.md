With scams and fraud on the rise, I thought Iâ€™d share a personal "near miss" experience and the steps I took to minimise the chance of it happening again. Hopefully this will never happen to you or anyone you know, but if it does, it may be helpful to know what to do and how to spot the warning signs.

### Wednesday, 9th October 2019
Towards the afternoon, I wasn't feeling too well and decided to head home and dial into some meetings remotely. Just as the last meeting wrapped up at around 5:30 PM, I noticed my phone signal drop out and a Telstra email notification appear.

Initially, I didn't pay too much attention to the email and thought maybe it was related to why I had lost phone service.

Moments later, I received another notification on my phone that someone was attempting to sign into my gmail account, asking whether it was me.

It was at that moment I realised that what was happening to me was something I'd read about only a few months before! Of course, I immediately pressed NO, IT'S NOT ME on the sign-in prompt. Had I been at work or on the way home from work (this was likely the intention of the 5:30 PM timing), I wouldn't have had WiFi and would not have been able to receive and decline the sign-in prompt. This could have resulted in a much worse outcome, with the attacker gaining access to my gmail account.

#### Some background on SIM-swapping
An unauthorised SIM-swap attack occurs when an attacker convinces a telco customer service representative (over the phone or in person) that they are _you_, so that they can move _your_ phone service from one physical SIM card (the one in your phone) to another physical SIM (in the hands of the attacker).

The attacker likely has their new SIM card with them so that the swap can take place quickly. The new SIM doesn't necessarily need to be with the same telco and could be from one Australian telco to another.

After the SIM swap is complete (which can take place in a matter of minutes), the attacker can then use your phone number with complete freedom (e.g. a gmail account recovery), and your SIM card will be rendered inactive.

As soon as I realised that I was a victim of an unauthorised SIM-swap attack, I called my wife to ask if she could quickly come home so that I could use her phone to call Telstra and seek help on how to manage the situation. After navigating through first-line customer service, I was eventually able to speak to someone from their fraud department.

During this stressful experience, it was relieving to be assigned a dedicated Telstra fraud specialist with a direct contact number, who was able to talk me through what had happened and the next steps.

### Thursday, 10th October 2019
Based on the advice of the fraud specialist, I went to a Telstra store to verify my identity in person and port the number back to a new SIM card. Having some knowledge of managing fraud in banking, I knew that the banking process involves applying a fraud flag to the account so that the next time the customer profile is pulled up for an enquiry, bankers will treat the account with an elevated level of caution.

While the Telstra store staff were finalising the new SIM for me and writing notes in their system, I could see their screen and where exactly on the customer relationship console (it looked like Siebel) they were capturing the notes.

I asked if the console had something to indicate that the account had been compromised, and they pointed to some notes that were hidden by their new notes!

With my new SIM set up, I left the store and went home to spend more time reviewing my gmail account security.
