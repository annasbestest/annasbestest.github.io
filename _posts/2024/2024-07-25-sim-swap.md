With scams and fraud on the rise, I thought Iâ€™d share a personal "near miss" experience and the steps I took to minimise the chance of it happening again. Hopefully, this will never happen to you or anyone you know, but if it does, it may be helpful to know what to do and how to spot the warning signs.

### Wednesday, 9th October 2019
My entire afternoon was planned to be spent in a cramped auditorium for a town hall meeting, so I decided to head home and dial in remotely. As the meeting wrapped up at around 5:30 PM, I noticed my phone signal drop out and a Telstra email notification appear.

Initially, I didn't pay too much attention to the email and thought maybe it was related to why I had lost phone service.

Moments later, I then received another notification on my phone that someone was attempting to sign into my account, and asking whether it was me.

It was at that moment I realised that what was happening to me was something I'd read about only a few months before!

Of course, I immediately pressed NO, IT'S NOT ME on the sign-in prompt. 

However, I'm not sure what would have happened if I wasn't at home and connected to WiFi, so that I actually _had the ability_ to receive the prompt. Or if I was using an iPhone instead that didn't have the prompt feature as part of the Android OS.

### Some background on SIM-swapping
An unauthorised SIM-swap attack occurs when an attacker convinces a telco customer service representative (over the phone or in person) that they are _you_, so that they can move _your_ phone service from one physical SIM card (the one in your phone) to another physical SIM (in the hands of the attacker).

The attacker likely has their new SIM card with them so that the swap can take place quickly. The new SIM doesn't necessarily need to be with the same telco and could be from one Australian telco to another.

After the SIM swap is complete (which can take place in a matter of minutes), the attacker can then use your phone number with complete freedom, and your SIM card will be rendered inactive.

As soon as I realised that I was a victim of an unauthorised SIM-swap attack, I called my wife to ask if she could quickly come home so that I could use her phone to call Telstra and explain what had happened. After navigating through first-line customer service, I was eventually able to speak to someone from their fraud department.

During this stressful experience, it was relieving to be assigned a dedicated fraud specialist with a direct contact number, who was able to talk me through what had happened and the next steps.

### Thursday, 10th October 2019
Based on the advice of the fraud specialist, I went to a Telstra store to verify my identity in person and port the number back to a new SIM card. Having some knowledge of fraud in banking, I knew that the banking process involves applying a fraud flag to the account so that the next time the customer profile is pulled up for an enquiry, bankers will know to treat the account with an elevated level of caution.

However, while the Telstra store staff were finalising the new SIM for me and noting this in their system, I could see their screen and where they were typing the notes.

I asked where the section was to show the next customer service agent that the account had been compromised by fraud, and they pointed to some notes that were buried by the new notes they had just written!
