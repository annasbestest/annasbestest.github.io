For the last 18 months the Walmer Street Bridge has been closed <a href="https://bicyclenetwork.com.au/newsroom/2023/12/20/walmer-street-bridge-ready-to-re-open/">(until recently)</a>. While it was closed, the detour added about 10 minutes to my commute. This closure and subsequent detour led me to reflect on the various `distinct` routes I've taken to work over the years, and what sets each one apart.

No laudem altera adolescens has, volumus lucilius eum no. Eam ei nulla audiam efficiantur. Suas affert per no, ei tale nibh sea. Sea ne magna harum, in denique scriptorem sea, cetero alienum tibique ei eos. Labores persequeris referrentur eos ei.
