For the last 18 months the Walmer Street Bridge has been closed <a href="https://bicyclenetwork.com.au/newsroom/2023/12/20/walmer-street-bridge-ready-to-re-open/">(until recently)</a>. While it was closed the detour added around 10 minutes to my ride to work. The closure and detour got me thinking about all the different (DISTINCT) routes that I have historically ridden to work.

No laudem altera adolescens has, volumus lucilius eum no. Eam ei nulla audiam efficiantur. Suas affert per no, ei tale nibh sea. Sea ne magna harum, in denique scriptorem sea, cetero alienum tibique ei eos. Labores persequeris referrentur eos ei.
