For the last 18 months the Walmer Street Bridge has been closed <a href="https://bicyclenetwork.com.au/newsroom/2023/12/20/walmer-street-bridge-ready-to-re-open/">(until recently)</a>. While it was closed, the detour added about 10 minutes to my commute. This closure and subsequent detour led me to reflect on the various `distinct` routes I've taken to work over the years, and what sets each one apart.

For instance, consider a morning when I take a slightly different path from my usual route, a variation I refer to as the 'Deviation'. Does this minor alteration qualify as an entirely new way of commuting to work? What if I briefly rode on the wrong side of the road for just 10 meters. While technically this is a different route, practically it's not significantly distinct from my usual route.
